The Contiki Operating System - With IoTUS framework
============================

More instrutions will be available soon.

Brief description
============================

IoTUS uses an extensible service layer that facilitates cross-layer sharing. It promotes sharing of both network control information (e.g., number of transmissions, receptions, collisions at the data-link layer) and functionality (e.g., neighbor discovery, aggregation) by different layers of the protocol stack. Additionally, IoTUS can be used by existing network stacks without having to modify the basic operation of their protocols.
